    <p class="block-narrow text">
        and I have more than a decade of experience building open source
        tools for the web. I’m comfortable working across the full stack,
        whether I’m creating a <a href="/ui-component-library">UI component
        library</a>, refactoring a <a href="/code-modernization">legacy code base</a>, or
        building a <a href="/find-your-representatives">data-driven app</a>. In my career, I’ve worn
        all sorts of hats. I’ve worked alone and in teams, led on frontend
        and backend tasks, and taken on <a href="/documentation">documentation and
        developer relations</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="block-narrow text">
        I had a previous career in journalism and I’m interested in working
        on projects at the intersection of information, communication, and
        social change. I believe technology is a means not a
        mission. No algorithm can tell us what a better world looks like.
        But well-built digital products can help watchdogs monitor,
        campaigners organise, and activists agitate.
