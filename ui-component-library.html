        I have more than a decade of experience building open source
        tools for the web. I’m comfortable working across the full stack,
        whether I’m creating a UI component library, refactoring a legacy
        code base, or building a data-driven app.

        I had a previous career in journalism and I’m interested in working
        on projects at the intersection of information, communication, and
        social change. I believe <a href="#">technology is a means not a
        mission</a>. No algorithm can tell us what a better world looks like.
        But well-built digital products can help watchdogs monitor,
        campaigners organise, and activists agitate.
